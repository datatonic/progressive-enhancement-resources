# Contributing

The purpose of this collection is to get more people hooked on and start using Progressive Enhancement.
Contributions should help towards this goal.

Contributions are always appreciated. But please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

## Guidelines

For new additions or changes to existing items, submit a pull request.
Only add/change 1 item per pull request.

### Collection format

We try to adhere to a strict format so please adhere to following guidelines:

* Add the item to the bottom of the relevant category.
* Use the format `[Title of link](url) - Short description.`
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but meaningful.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

### Pull request

To merge your suggestion as quickly as possible we ask you to follow these guidelines:

* Give the PR a meaningful title, like "add Resource X to examples".
* Explain why you think this item should be added to the collection in the description.
* Only add/change 1 item per PR.
* If you submit an item that is similar to an existing item in the list, argument how it's better.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it.
If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.


Thank you for your suggestion!
